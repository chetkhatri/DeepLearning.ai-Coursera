# This Repository contains all my work for this Deep Learning.ai specialisation. All the assignments were provided by the course itself. 
## This repository aims to help those who might after spending hours on assignments struggle to complete the snippets of code.
## I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for enlightening us all with such a wonderful course in Deep Learning!
